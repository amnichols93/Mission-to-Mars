# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10

## To Run the Page:
### *Note, you will need to have the following on your computer to run this page properly: Flask, Python, Pandas, Splinter, webdriver_manager.chrome, and BeautifulSoup.

1) Download the Mars_Scraping directory from this GitHub page

2) Navigate to the folder in your terminal

3) Run "python appChallenge.py" in the terminal

4) Go to Chrome and run the page for the localserver indicated by your terminal (likely http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

-- If you run into any issues, it is likely because there is an problem reading the dependencies required to run the app. GitHub pages can't run flask apps without turning it into a static page so this is the best we can do :/
